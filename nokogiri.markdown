# Getting Started with Nokogiri

Parsing XML and HTML is something most programmers 

FUCK!!!!!!  INRO GOES HERE

## Installation

Nokogiri is actually a wrapper around the excellent HTML/XML parsing library
written by [Daniel Veillard called libxml2][http://xmlsoft.org/].  Since
Nokogiri simply wraps and builds upon this already existing library,
installing libxml2 is a prerequisite for installing Nokogiri.  Fortunately,
libxml2 has been ported to most systems, so installing libxml2 should be
pretty easy.

### OS X

I recommend installing libxml2 on OS X from [macports][http://macports.org].
OS X ships with libxml2 installed, but macports is more up to date, so I
recommend using it instead.

To install libxml2 from macports do this:

    $ sudo port install libxml2 libxslt

Then to install nokogiri:

    $ sudo gem install nokogiri

That should be it!
